# URL Shortener UI

Our company is building a knock off of the site [bitly](https://bitly.com/) to shorten long links. The site will take in a long link and give the user a shortened link that they can put in their browser and be taken to the original long link.

For example, this app will be able to:
* Take in a long link like `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470114716159-e389f8712fda?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2550&q=80`
* Submit the long link to a server
* The server will give back a short link like `http://localhost:3001/useshorturl/1`
* The short link will send the user to the same link as the long link! (some server magic that you don't need to worry about)

*Note: the example above will not readily work in the browser*

Wow, that saves a lot of space by making the URL shorter! The back-end API will save all of the URLs that have been submitted to be shortened so the user can come back and use them later.

The back-end server is already setup and ready to go from the back-end team. [The back-end server is located here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/url-shortener-api).

We need to build a front-end for users to interact with.

## Setup

* Fork, then clone down this repo and change into the cloned down directory
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start your development server

Be sure to setup the back-end repo for URL Shortener (NOT nested in the FE repo) to be able to retrieve and save shortened URLs.

## Iterations

### Iteration 0

Make sure to read through all iterations before starting. There is additional API documentation in the README of the BE server; it's highly recommended that you read that closely as well. 

### Iteration 1

A developer just left the company, and they started this front-end. Unfortunately, they didn't document their process or where they left off. 

- Read through the front-end code base. Take a look at what urls are currently stored in the server. 
- Fix any bugs/finish the unfinished functionality that are preventing the app from running.
- Connect the front end to the back end. When the App loads, grab any existing urls on the server, and display them on the DOM. 

### Iteration 2

Right now the App component can receive information from the server, but not send information to it. 

- When the form is submitted, the new url should POST to the the server.
- On a _successful_ POST, the new shortened url should be added to the DOM as well. 

*The user should see the new url without the page refreshing.  The new url should persist on the DOM after refreshing as well.*

### Iteration 3

Write Cypress tests for the following user flows.  All network requests must be stubbed.

* When a user visits the page, they can view the page title, form and the existing shortened URLs
* When a user fills out the form, the information is reflected in the input field values
* When a user fills out and submits the form, the new shortened URL is rendered

### Iteration 4 (extension)

Add and test sad path functionality. For example:
- What should happen if the server sends back a failed request?
- What should happen if the user tries to submit an incomplete form?

### Iteration 5 (extension)

Add and test delete functionality for a URL (the server side endpoint already exists).
